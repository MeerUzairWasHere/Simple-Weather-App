# Simple-Weather-App

The Git repo of a simple weather app would include all the necessary files and code to run the app on a web server or a local machine. This could include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as any necessary dependencies or third-party libraries.

The app would likely consist of a user interface that allows users to enter a location and retrieve the current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app could use an API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to retrieve weather data for a specific location.

The Git repo may also include documentation, such as a README file, outlining how to install and run the app, as well as any troubleshooting tips or known issues. It may also include a license and a contribution guide, outlining how others can contribute to the project.

Overall, the Git repo of a simple weather app would provide all the necessary code and files for developers to build and run a basic weather app.
